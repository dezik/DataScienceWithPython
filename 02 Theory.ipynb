    "## Types of data\n",
    "1. Numerical (weight, stock price)\n",

    "## Mean, Median, Mode\n",
    "1. Mean - synonym to `average`\n",
    "    `(1+2+3+4+5)/5` -> **3**\n",
    "2. Median - sort the values and get midpoint:\n",
    "    `0,2,3,2,1,0,0,2,0` -> `0,0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3` -> **1**\n",
    "3. Mode - most common value in dataset\n",

    "**Probability Density function** - Gives you the probability of a data point falling within some given range of a given value. Example is normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Percentiles and moments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Percentiles** - shows the point in a sorted dataset at which X% of values are less than given value. Median is equal to 50% percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moments** : \n",
    "1. The first moment is the *mean*. \n",
    "2. Second is *variance*. \n",
    "3. The third is *skew*.\n",
    "Distribution with a longer left tail has negative skew, with longer right tail - positive skew.\n",
    "4. The fourth moment is *kurtosis*. Shows how thick it the tail and how sharp is the peak, compared to normal distribution. High peaks have higher kurtosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Covariance and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance** - Covariance measures how two variables vary in tandem from their means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation** normalizes everything by their standard deviations, giving you an easier to understand value that ranges from -1 (for a perfect inverse correlation) to 1 (for a perfect positive correlation)\n",
